## What I leanred(Continue to be modified)

1. Basic HTML

- element naming convention: parent\_\_child
- span is used for a text
- Should not use `li` inside `li` (causes a bug)

2. Basic CSS

- Make css files small as much as possible
- content -> padding -> border -> margin
- Animation: Fade In when loading a page
- Media query: Show a warning message when a page size is bigger than the particular size
